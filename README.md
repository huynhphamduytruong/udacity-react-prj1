# MyReads Project

MyRead is a simple book managing app that help you to manage your books in one of these suppported categories:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

It also support you search for books based on the title and author.

This is the 1st project required for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

## Developing

To get started developing right away:

- Clone the project
- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start`
- Open browser and access `localhost:3000`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
